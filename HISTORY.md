- [x] Support for result extraction

**2020.12.12**, Big changes! I will submit my paper to ACL 2021 recently (accepted!). Before that, I want to publish this repo to `pypi` so that you can install it by `pip install ...` directly. I rename `alchemist` to `manytasks` to make the name of the tool easier to recognize, and change the description *A toy tool for deep learning, which helps explore different net configurations.* to *A tool for deploying many tasks automatically.*

- [x] Colorize the CLI tools
- [x] Disable the web UI by default
- [x] Support for configuration with python script
- [x] Support for init a config
- [x] Support for showing the results

**2019.12.11**, About one year later, after submitting my ACL 2020 paper (accepted!), I add some new features to the tool. Good luck~

- [x] Use `.hjson` (<https://hjson.org/>) instead of `.json` for configuration, since `.hjson` is more human-readable which allows comments and missing/trailing commas
- [x] Ask the user for overriding existing logs
- [x] Beautify the CLI tools

**2019.1.1**, First version comes out. I wrote the code to enable grid search for my ACL 2019 submission. Unfortunately it was rejected. :(

- [x] Enumerate different configurations
- [x] Specify which GPU card to use
- [x] Specify the number of processes
- [x] Web UI support
- [x] Show the last 100 lines of logs
- [x] Show the GPU overload
